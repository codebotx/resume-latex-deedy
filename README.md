This is a modified ONE COLUMN version of the following template:
Deedy - One Page Two Column Resume
LaTeX Template
Version 1.1 (30/4/2014)
Original author:
[Debarghya Das] (<http://debarghyadas.com>)
[Original repository]:
 <https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume>
IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

TODO:

1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
4. Add location/address information
5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

CHANGELOG:

Known Issues:

1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
